The new NBA season for 2023-24 is around the corner.   In this project, I am trying to pull out data about the NBA teams and players from the above website, perform detailed analysis on the information and dig out interesting information and statistics on what to expect in this new NBA season.

###Interesting findings:

1) While quite a number of the experienced players are at their mid / late 30s, the players in the NBA is actually quite young.  50% of the players are under 25.
