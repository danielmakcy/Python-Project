The new NBA season for 2023-24 is around the corner.   In this project, I am trying to pull out data about the NBA teams and players from the above website, perform detailed analysis on the information and dig out interesting information and statistics on what to expect in this new NBA season.

### Interesting findings:

### Player's Age
1) While quite a number of the experienced players are at their mid / late 30s, the players in the NBA is actually quite young.  50% of the players are under 25.

### Experience

1) While most of the players in the regular roster are having years of experience, 50% of the players are having 3 years of experience or less.   This might reflect the less experience player are on the reserve list and have less play time.

2) GSW is the most experience team in the NBA.  POR and UAT are the least experienced teams.

3) While experience level are significantly different for each team, there is no major differnece in term of experience for teams in East and West Conference.
